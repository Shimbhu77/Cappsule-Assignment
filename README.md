### To retrieve the details of a particular medicine item, you can follow these steps:

- Upload the data from the CSV file to your MySQL database using the LOAD DATA INFILE command.

- Once the data is loaded into the database, you can use an API to retrieve the details of a specific medicine item. For example, you could use the following API endpoint: http://localhost:8888/medicine?name={itemName}, where {itemName} is the name of the medicine item you want to retrieve.

- Replace <itemName> in the API endpoint with the name of the medicine item you want to retrieve, and then hit the API using a web browser or a tool like cURL.

- The API will return a response containing the complete details of the medicine item, including its name, composition, manufacturer, and any other relevant information.
